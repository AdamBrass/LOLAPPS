# Living off the Land Applications
LOLAPPS is a compendium of applications that can be used to carry out day-to-day exploitation. 

Kind of like the cousin of LOLBAS and GTFObins. Sometimes you might struggle to find binaries to exploit
and LOLAPPS is meant to be a supplementary resource for identifying native functionality in applications
that can be use to the hacker's advantage.

*Eventually* the repository will get reworked into a frontend, but for now, see CONTRIBUTING.md for
the PR contribution template and see the "yml" directory for a list of running/desired techniques, grouped by function.
