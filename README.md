# Living off the Land Applications
LOLAPPS is a compendium of applications that can be used to carry out day-to-day exploitation. 

Kind of like the cousin of LOLBAS and GTFObins. Sometimes you might struggle to find built-in binaries to exploit
and LOLAPPS is meant to be a supplementary resource for identifying native functionality in applications
that can be used to the hacker's advantage.

# Mission
*Eventually* the repository will get reworked into a frontend. Once the repository gets ~15-20 techniques,
we will start looking into our options for making it easy to search, and prettier on the eyes.
